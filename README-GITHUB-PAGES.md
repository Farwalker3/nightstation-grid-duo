# GitHub Pages Setup Complete!

Your repository is now configured for GitHub Pages deployment.

## What's been set up:

1. ✅ Updated `vite.config.ts` with correct base path for GitHub Pages
2. ⏳ GitHub Actions workflow (you'll need to create this manually)
3. ⏳ Next: Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings

## GitHub Actions Workflow File:

Create this file: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pages: write
      id-token: write
    
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        cache: 'npm'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    
    - name: Build
      run: npm run build
      env:
        NODE_ENV: production
    
    - name: Setup Pages
      uses: actions/configure-pages@v4
    
    - name: Upload artifact
      uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
      with:
        path: './dist'
    
    - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      id: deployment
      uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

## Final Steps:

1. Create the workflow file above at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
2. Go to Repository Settings → Pages
3. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
4. Save the settings

## How it works:
- Every push to the `main` branch will trigger a build and deployment
- The workflow builds your Vite React app and deploys it to GitHub Pages
- No manual intervention needed after the initial setup!
